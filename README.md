# lua-api-learning

I'm just learning how to make a secure Lua API in Python. It sounds fun for programming games. I think it would be awesome to host a server where people can make games and bots in Lua (or maybe later C++).

## TODO
 - Handle script errors
 - Handle script timeout (5s for game? 1s for player?)
 - Handle multiple player scripts
 - Run multiple games in parallel
